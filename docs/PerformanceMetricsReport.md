# AI Model Performance Metrics Report

Our AI vision model is tasked with interpreting handwritten notes and structuring this data into a JSON format that matches our predefined schema. The accuracy of this process is critical for the reliability of our application. We measure this accuracy through three key metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**.

## Metrics Explained

Before diving into the report, let's clarify what each metric signifies:

- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of identifications made by the AI that were actually correct. A high precision means the AI has a low rate of false positives (incorrect identifications).
- **Recall**: Measures the AI's ability to find all relevant instances (tasks/attributes) in the data. High recall means the AI is good at capturing everything it's supposed to.
- **F1 Score**: Provides a single metric to evaluate the balance between precision and recall, giving us a comprehensive view of the model's accuracy.

## Sample Output Analysis

Here's an example of the performance metrics from one of our recent evaluations:

```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "title": {
      "precision": 0.985,
      "recall": 0.985,
      "f1Score": 0.985
    },
    "time": {
      "precision": 0.769,
      "recall": 0.769,
      "f1Score": 0.769
    },
    "date": {
      "precision": 1,
      "recall": 1,
      "f1Score": 1
    },
    "tags": {
      "precision": 0.467,
      "recall": 0.636,
      "f1Score": 0.538
    }
  },
  "OverallMetrics": {
    "precision": 0.805,
    "recall": 0.848,
    "f1Score": 0.823,
    "totalAttributes": 4
  }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis

- **Title** and **Date**: Show exceptional performance, with precision, recall, and F1 scores all at or near perfect. This indicates that the model is highly accurate in recognizing and interpreting the title and date from handwritten notes.

- **Time**: Displays good accuracy, though there's room for improvement. The model correctly interprets time details from the notes about 77% of the time.

- **Tags**: This is the area with the most room for improvement. The model's precision is under 50%, indicating that it often identifies tags that weren't actually present or misses the correct tags.

## Conclusion

The **OverallMetrics** provide a consolidated view of our AI model's performance across all evaluated attributes. With an overall precision of 0.805 and recall of 0.848, the model demonstrates strong capability, particularly in accurately identifying key details like titles and dates. The lower performance in tag identification suggests an area for targeted improvement.
