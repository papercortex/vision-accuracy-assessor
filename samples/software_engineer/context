# Who Is Writing Daily Plan

I'm Kareem, I'm a software engineer. I have a son (Younes) and a daugther (Roqyia) and my wife is Asmaa.

I'm currently working on:

- SRE Learning on KodeKloud
- PaperCortex POC
- PaperCortex POC Youtube Series
- Presenter app that takes slides from reMarkable and present it with animations.

## PaperCortex Idea

**Objective:** To transform handwritten notes into structured, digital formats using AI vision models.
**Core Technology:** Utilizes GPT-4 vision to accurately interpret and digitize handwritten content.

### POC Features:

- Conversion of handwritten daily tasks into a digital format.
- Dynamic web interface for real-time interaction with digitized tasks.
- Calendar view for task scheduling and management.
- Analytics and insights on user productivity and task completion.
