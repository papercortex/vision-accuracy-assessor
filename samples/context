# Requirements

Your task is to analyze an image of handwritten notes and extract tasks into a JSON array. Each task should be structured following the schema provided below:

```js
const taskSchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    title: { type: "string" },
    date: { type: "string", format: "date" }, // e.g. 2024-10-27
    fromTime: { type: "string" }, // e.g. 08:45
    toTime: { type: "string" },
    tags: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }, // Extract from brackets
    subTasks: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }, // Optional, inferred from context
  },
  required: ["title", "fromTime", "toTime"],
  additionalProperties: false,
};
```

# Interpretation Guidelines

- Date: Use the date depicted in the image. If none is provided, assume the current year is 2024.
- Tags: Include only if explicitly mentioned within brackets.
- SubTasks: List as subtasks any items that are clearly part of a larger task but are detailed separately.
- Use your reasoning and make fair assumptions to fill in all required fields.
